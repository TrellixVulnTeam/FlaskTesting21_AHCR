Bryan Prichard's Flask Testing Page

Goals:

1- Make a local flask server (Complete)

2- Add https to a local flask server

3- test on flask 1.1.4 as the newest version of flask may be causing issues (Complete, flask 2.0.1 was not the issue)

4- research into getting a https certificate

5- Create a working webpage using flask and https

6- Brainstorm on getting https to work on chaoss/augur



Files:

app.py is a practice "hello world" file

login.html and loginTest.py are a first attempt at https integration.
